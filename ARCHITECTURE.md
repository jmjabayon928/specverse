## 1) System Overview

SpecVerse is a production-grade engineering system of record for EPC, industrial, and facilities projects. It unifies engineering datasheets, schedules, estimations, inventory, verification records, and exports into an auditable, multi-tenant platform.

**What makes SpecVerse different** is that it treats engineering artifacts as **structured, lifecycle-aware entities** (not static documents), enabling consistent governance, revision control, QA/QC evidence, downstream cost impact, and future AI-assist workflows—without sacrificing accountability.

SpecVerse has been validated through a realistic Water/Wastewater engineering pilot demonstrating facility hierarchy, MEL (Mechanical Equipment List), Asset 360 views, datasheet workflows, estimation, inventory tracking, and verification processes.

---

## 2) Architectural Goals (Non‑Negotiables)

SpecVerse is deliberately engineered around these constraints:

### 2.1 Correctness and integrity over convenience

- Engineering data must remain **internally consistent**.
- Write operations that change a “compound object” should be **atomic**.
- The backend should prefer “replace-all / transactional writes” over partial mutation patterns when data integrity is at risk.

### 2.2 Multi‑tenant isolation

- Account boundaries must be enforced in **API handlers, queries, and persistence**.
- Tenant isolation should be difficult to bypass accidentally.

### 2.3 Governance and least privilege

- “Keys to the kingdom” actions are protected by explicit authority checks.
- Operator / support access is **platform-scoped** and must not silently become account-scoped authority.

### 2.4 Traceability and auditability

- Critical actions are recorded in audit logs.
- Exports and approvals should leave **evidence trails** suitable for QA/QC and compliance workflows.

### 2.5 Extensibility without schema churn

- Template-driven configuration must allow new datasheet/schedule formats without rewriting the application.

### 2.6 Test stability

- Tests should be resilient to refactors and avoid cascade failures.
- Shared test helpers should prevent drift and repeated mocking strategies.

---

## 3) High-Level Architecture

### 3.1 Component map

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
- **Auth:** JWT-based session (cookie or Authorization header), server-enforced RBAC
- **Exports/Jobs:** Background job patterns for large downloads/exports (where applicable)
- **Audit:** Centralized insert path + middleware hooks for request/response logging
- Facilities hierarchy (Facility → Systems → Assets) used in engineering pilots

## 4) Backend Architecture (Code Organization)

### 4.1 Layering model

SpecVerse follows a conventional layered backend structure:

- **Routes**: define URL surface + middleware chain
- **Controllers**: request parsing, validation, mapping HTTP → service calls
- **Services**: business rules, transaction boundaries, orchestration
- **Repositories / database query modules**: SQL access (parameterized queries only)
- **Middleware**: auth, tenant scoping, auditing, error handling

This layered architecture enables engineering modules such as datasheets, estimations, facilities navigation, and asset lifecycle views to evolve without violating transactional integrity or tenant isolation.

### 4.2 Transaction boundaries

Use explicit SQL transactions when:

- A workflow updates multiple rows/tables as part of a single logical operation
- Invariants must remain consistent (e.g., single-owner invariant)
- A “replace-all” update must be atomic

---

## 5) Multi‑Tenancy, Roles, Permissions, and Governance

This section is the **authoritative explanation** of “who can do what” and why.

### 5.1 Terms

- **Account**: tenant boundary (organization / environment boundary)
- **Account member**: a user’s membership inside an account
- **Role**: permission bundle assigned to a member in an account
- **Permission**: granular capability enforced by middleware/guards
- **Owner**: the _account_’s primary authority for “keys to the kingdom”
- **Platform Admin (Superadmin)**: platform operator for account maintenance/support actions

### 5.2 Authority domains

#### A) Account-scoped authority (tenant domain)

These actions operate **inside a specific account**:

- Create/modify templates
- Create/modify filled sheets
- Inventory, estimation, exports, approvals
- Member role changes (when allowed)
- Account-scoped administration (Admin role)

**Admin role** is a _role within an account_.

- Admin commonly maps to “all permissions” **within that account scope**.
- Admin is not the platform owner of the system.

#### B) Platform-scoped authority (operator domain)

Platform Admin is intended for **support / ops** tasks:

- Fix account access incidents
- Restore or repair account ownership/admin access
- Perform safe account maintenance
- Operate platform endpoints that do not rely on account membership

Platform Admin is **not** a role within an account.

- Platform Admin **must not** silently become “Admin for every account” unless explicitly designed (generally discouraged).
- Platform Admin endpoints should not depend on account-scoped context unless a very deliberate “impersonation / break-glass” design is implemented with strong auditing.

### 5.3 Account Owner (not a role)

Owner is not a role; it is modeled explicitly:

- `Accounts.OwnerUserID`
- `AccountMembers.IsOwner`

**Invariants**

- **Single owner invariant**: exactly one owner per account.
- Owner cannot be deactivated in ways that orphan the account.
- Ownership transfer must be transactional and atomic.

### 5.4 Hybrid Governance (Option B)

The governance policy used:

**Owner-only (“keys to the kingdom”)**

- Transfer ownership
- Disable / delete account
- Billing authority (future)

**Permission-based (not owner-only)**

- Member role changes
- Member activation/deactivation
- Other admin actions

### 5.5 Why this matters

Large multi-tenant systems frequently fail when:

- Account authority and platform authority are conflated
- “Support users” can accidentally act as “admins everywhere”
- The UI guesses privilege state based on incomplete session data

SpecVerse avoids this by:

- Keeping platform authority orthogonal to account RBAC
- Enforcing owner-only actions with explicit invariants
- Exposing session scope explicitly so the UI does not guess

---

## 6) Authentication, Session, and Context Attachment

### 6.1 Token sources

JWT may be provided via:

- Cookie token
- Authorization header (`Bearer <token>`)

### 6.2 Request user (`req.user`) contract

At minimum, after token verification the request has:

- `userId`
- identity fields (email/name/profilePic where available)

For **account-scoped routes**, the backend attaches account context:

- `accountId`
- `roleId`, `roleName`
- `permissions[]`
- `isOwner`, `ownerUserId`

For **platform routes**, the system should avoid requiring account context:

- Use token verification without forcing account membership
- Use platform-admin checks against `PlatformAdmins`

### 6.3 Platform admin detection

Platform admin detection should be sourced from:

- The **PlatformAdmins table** (primary, durable)
- Optional ENV overrides (for bootstrap / emergency)

**Important**: platform admin is distinct from account admin.

### 6.4 Session response design

The session endpoint should expose scope explicitly so the UI can gate features deterministically.

Recommended fields (and already aligned with recent hardening work):

- `accountId`, `roleId`, `roleName`
- `permissions[]`, `permissionsCount`
- `isOwner`, `ownerUserId`
- `isPlatformAdmin` (platform scope flag)
- keep `isSuperadmin` only for backward compatibility if needed

---

## 7) Platform Superadmin (Support / Ops)

### 7.1 Purpose

Platform endpoints exist to support operations without requiring account membership. Examples:

- Grant / revoke platform admin access
- Perform account maintenance workflows (future)
- Safe platform diagnostics (future)

### 7.2 Security posture

- Require authentication (token verified)
- Require platform admin check (DB-driven)
- Prefer explicit endpoints with strict auditing
- Prevent foot-guns:
  - no self-revoke
  - explicit 409 when already active
  - strict parameter validation

### 7.3 Auditing platform actions

Platform actions must write to the audit system, capturing:

- action name (e.g., `PLATFORM_ADMIN_GRANT`, `PLATFORM_ADMIN_REVOKE`)
- performedBy (actor userId)
- recordId (target userId)
- route/method/statusCode
- changes metadata

---

## 8) Audit Logging and Traceability

SpecVerse is audit-first. Audit mechanisms generally include:

- middleware capturing route/method/status codes
- explicit audit calls in sensitive workflows (governance, platform)

Audit goals:

- support QA/QC evidence
- enable forensic debugging
- provide a compliance-ready trail

**Guidance**:

- For high-risk actions, prefer explicit, structured audit entries
- Ensure audit entries can be correlated to entities (tableName + recordId)
- Prefer deterministic shapes and avoid “opaque blobs” when possible

---

## 9) Exports, Jobs, and Large Operations

Large operations (exports, bulk downloads) should be designed to:

- avoid blocking requests
- provide job status, retry, cancellation where appropriate
- secure downloads (signed URLs, expiry windows)
- leave audit trails

Export jobs are persisted in the ExportJobs table and processed by background workers using retry scheduling fields such as NextAttemptAt, AttemptCount, and MaxAttempts to ensure reliability and resilient retry behavior.

---

## 10) Internationalization

SpecVerse supports multilingual engineering environments, including:

- UI translations
- template translations (field labels, subsheets)
- export correctness (language-aware outputs)

---

## 11) AI Foundation and Continuous Intelligence (Architecture Vision)

SpecVerse is designed to support AI-assisted insights without violating engineering accountability:

- AI should suggest, summarize, and flag inconsistencies
- Decisions remain attributable to humans
- AI outputs should be explainable and auditable

Because engineering data in SpecVerse is structured and lifecycle-aware, the platform can support AI-assisted analysis such as datasheet anomaly detection, estimation insights, and asset performance summaries.

---

## 12) Testing Strategy and Quality Gates

### 12.1 What must always pass

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm test -- --runInBand --no-cache`
- `npm run build`

### 12.2 Test architecture principles

- Shared helpers to avoid drift (especially auth)
- Deterministic fixtures (no time dependence, no randomness)
- Small, boring helpers that reduce copy-paste
- Avoid snapshot tests for APIs

### 12.3 Shared helpers (core)

- `tests/helpers/authMiddlewareMock.ts` – shared auth harness (required)
- `tests/helpers/httpAsserts.ts` – standardized HTTP status assertions
- `tests/helpers/permissions.ts` – permission-surface helpers
- `tests/helpers/fixtures.ts` – explicit factories and constants

Rule:

> No test suite should re-invent auth mocking; it must use the shared helper.

---

## 13) Operational Model: Branches, Environments, and Releases

SpecVerse uses:

- `main` as production branch
- `staging` as staging branch

Recommended practice:

- CI on both branches
- staging used for pre-prod validation
- production releases via main

---

## 14) Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This section records key architectural decisions that shape SpecVerse’s
engineering design. These decisions provide historical context and help
future maintainers understand why certain patterns were chosen.

### ADR-001: Multi-Tenant Account Isolation

SpecVerse enforces strict tenant isolation using AccountID scoping across
API handlers, queries, and persistence layers to prevent accidental
cross-tenant access.

### ADR-002: Replace-All Transactional Datasheet Writes

Complex datasheet updates are written using replace-all transactional
patterns to guarantee atomic updates and preserve data integrity.

### ADR-003: Platform Admin Separate from Account Admin

Platform administrators operate at the system level and are intentionally
separated from account-scoped roles to prevent accidental cross-tenant
privilege escalation.

### ADR-004: Export Jobs via Background Workers

Large exports are processed asynchronously through background job workers
to prevent long-running HTTP requests and to support retry and monitoring
capabilities.

## Appendix A — README Reference

The project README (`README.md`) remains the canonical source for:

- Project overview
- Feature list and roadmap
- Setup and run instructions
- Phase tracking and delivery status
- AI vision and product direction

This architecture document intentionally avoids duplicating that content
to prevent documentation drift.

See: `README.md`
