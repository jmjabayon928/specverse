## SpecVerse

SpecVerse is a production-grade engineering system of record for EPC, industrial, and facilities projects. It is designed for engineering teams, EPC firms, and asset-heavy organizations that need structured, auditable, and scalable control over engineering data across projects and disciplines.

It unifies datasheets, equipment specifications, schedules, estimations, inventory, verification records, and exports into a single, auditable, multi-tenant platform—designed to scale across disciplines, projects, and organizations.

SpecVerse has been validated through a realistic Water/Wastewater engineering pilot demonstrating facility hierarchy, asset organization, datasheet workflows, estimation, inventory tracking, and engineering verification processes.

Unlike traditional tools that treat datasheets as static documents, SpecVerse models engineering data as structured, lifecycle-aware entities with approvals, revisions, traceability, and downstream impact on cost, procurement, and operations.

## Industry Problem

Engineering organizations managing large infrastructure projects often rely on a fragmented toolchain:

• spreadsheets for datasheets  
• document repositories for specifications  
• ERP systems for procurement  
• manual exports for engineering documentation  

This fragmentation leads to:

• duplicated engineering data  
• lack of traceability between design, procurement, and verification  
• inconsistent approval workflows  
• costly manual document generation  

SpecVerse addresses this problem by providing a **single engineering system of record** for structured equipment data and engineering workflows.

## 🌟 Key Innovation — Dynamic Engineering Data, Not Static Forms

SpecVerse solves a long-standing engineering bottleneck:
- Every time a new datasheet or schedule format was needed, teams had to build a new app, spreadsheet, or database schema.
- SpecVerse eliminates this entirely.

At its core is a dynamic, no-code template engine:
- Datasheet and schedule structures are configurable at runtime
- Subsections, fields, units, rules, and workflows are defined without code
- No schema or application changes are required for new formats
- Engineers and admins—not developers—own and evolve templates

This enables true no-code engineering configuration, dramatically reducing custom development cost and tool sprawl while improving consistency, auditability, and reuse across projects.

## 🧭 Architectural Positioning

SpecVerse is intentionally designed as:
- A system of record — not a document repository or file manager
- A multi-tenant engineering platform with strict account isolation, roles, and permissions
- A QA/QC and compliance-ready foundation with approvals, verification records, audit trails, and exportable evidence
- An AI-ready platform that can evolve toward assistive intelligence without compromising engineering judgment or accountability
- Validated through a water and wastewater facility pilot architecture

Every architectural decision — schema design, replace-all transactions, audit logging, permission enforcement, and comprehensive testing — reinforces these principles.

---

### 🧪 Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance

SpecVerse emphasizes provable correctness over optimistic assumptions, with tests designed to enforce invariants across permissions, tenancy, transactions, and audit behavior. It is developed with a production-grade testing strategy spanning backend, frontend, domain logic, and security boundaries. Tests are organized by layer and responsibility, mirroring the platform’s architecture.

### 🔧 Backend API Tests

---

### 🔐 Access Control, Roles & Permissions

SpecVerse implements a fine-grained, permission-driven RBAC system designed for real engineering, QA/QC, and operations workflows.

Access control is not hard-coded by role.
Instead, roles are collections of explicit permissions, enforced consistently across backend APIs and frontend UI.

Note: Roles apply only **within an account**.
They do not grant platform-level authority or ownership rights.

#### **Roles (Current)**

SpecVerse supports multiple operational roles aligned with real-world engineering organizations:

**Admin**
- Full system access within an account
- Manages users, roles, permissions, and account settings
- Can override approvals when explicitly permitted

**Manager**
- Oversight role across datasheets, estimations, schedules, and reports
- Typically holds approval, verification, and reporting permissions

**Engineer**
- Creates and edits datasheets, templates, instrumentation, ratings, and schedules
- Cannot approve or override without explicit permissions

**Estimator**
- Focused on estimation creation, editing, verification, and export
- No implicit access to datasheet approval or account management

**QA**
- Verification and inspection-oriented role
- Manages verification records, reviews compliance evidence, and audits changes

**Reviewer**
- Read-heavy role for structured review workflows
- May verify or comment without authoring privileges

**Maintenance**
- Inventory maintenance and operational updates
- Handles maintenance logs, asset condition updates, and related records

**Warehouse**
- Inventory-focused role
- Manages stock levels, transactions, and exports without access to engineering edits

**Viewer**
- Read-only access
- Can view and export permitted records but cannot modify data

Note:
The legacy Supervisor role is deprecated. Its responsibilities are now modeled explicitly through permissions and newer roles (Manager, QA, Reviewer).

### Platform Superadmin (Support / Ops)

SpecVerse includes a dedicated **Platform Superadmin** capability for operational support and system-level maintenance.

Platform Superadmins:

- Are **not tied to any account**
- Do **not inherit account roles or permissions**
- Cannot perform account-scoped actions (engineering, estimation, inventory, etc.)
- Operate only through platform-specific endpoints

Supported actions include:

- Listing active platform administrators
- Granting or revoking platform admin access
- Platform-level audit visibility for support and compliance
- System maintenance and recovery workflows (account reactivation, admin recovery)

Platform Superadmin access is enforced via:

- Dedicated middleware (`verifyTokenOnly` + `requirePlatformAdmin`)
- Database-backed authorization (`PlatformAdmins` table)
- Full audit logging for all grant/revoke actions

This separation ensures:
- Zero cross-tenant privilege leakage
- No accidental escalation into account-level authority
- Clear operational boundaries between support and engineering teams

---

### 🏛 Account Ownership Model (Critical Distinction)

SpecVerse separates **platform governance**, **account ownership**, and **account administration**
into three intentionally distinct authority layers.

This separation prevents accidental privilege escalation and mirrors best practices used by
enterprise SaaS platforms.

#### Platform Superadmin (Global Scope)

Platform Superadmins operate **above all accounts**.

They exist solely for:
- Platform maintenance and recovery
- Account reactivation
- Ownership recovery
- Administrative support operations

Platform Superadmins:
- ❌ Do not belong to any account
- ❌ Do not inherit account roles or permissions
- ❌ Cannot perform engineering, estimation, inventory, or datasheet actions
- ✅ Can grant or revoke platform admin access
- ✅ Can recover locked or orphaned accounts
- ✅ Are fully audit-logged

---

#### Account Owner (Per-Account, Ultimate Authority)

Each account has **exactly one Account Owner**.

The Account Owner represents the **business authority** for that account.

Account Owners:
- ✅ Are members of the account
- ✅ Always retain ownership even if role assignments change
- ✅ Can transfer ownership to another active account member
- ✅ Can deactivate or delete the account
- ✅ Can recover or reinstate account admins
- ❌ Cannot override platform governance

Ownership is **not a role** — it is an invariant property of the account.

---

#### Account Admin (Per-Account, Operational Authority)

Account Admins manage **day-to-day operations** within an account.

Admins:
- ✅ Manage users, roles, and permissions
- ✅ Create and approve templates and datasheets
- ✅ Manage inventory, estimations, and schedules
- ✅ Access audit logs and reports (when permitted)
- ❌ Cannot transfer account ownership
- ❌ Cannot delete or recover the account

Admins are powerful — but **always subordinate to the Account Owner**.

---

This model ensures:
- Clear escalation paths
- Zero cross-tenant privilege leakage
- Safe recovery workflows
- Predictable authority boundaries

### 🔐 Permission Model

#### Ownership vs Roles

Account ownership is evaluated **outside** the role-based permission system.

- An **Account Owner** may hold any role
- Ownership checks **always take precedence** over role permissions
- Ownership authority **cannot be revoked accidentally** through role changes

This guarantees a stable governance model even as roles evolve.

---

#### Permission Design Principles

Permissions are:
- **Explicit** (no hidden or implicit grants)
- **Composable** (roles are built from permissions)
- **Enforceable** (checked at runtime, not assumed)

They cover all major system actions and are designed for long-term extensibility.

---

- Strict account-scoped data isolation
- No implicit privilege escalation

##### Frontend Enforcement
- Route-level access gating
- Conditional UI rendering
- Graceful handling of `403 Forbidden` responses

---

• Tailwind UI components
• Server-first rendering

Backend
• Node.js + Express
• Controller → Service → Repository architecture
• Strict RBAC enforcement
• Multi-tenant data isolation

Database
• Microsoft SQL Server
• Normalized relational schema
• Account-scoped entities
• transactional write guarantees

Infrastructure
• VPS deployment
• nginx reverse proxy
• PM2 process management
• automated migrations via Flyway

Testing
• API integration tests
• domain logic tests
• repository tests
• UI tests (React Testing Library)

## 📦 Tech Stack

SpecVerse is built as a production-grade, full-stack engineering SaaS with strong emphasis on data integrity, auditability, and long-term extensibility.

## 🧠 Backend

Node.js + Express (TypeScript) — layered controller → service → repository architecture

SQL Server — normalized, account-scoped relational model

Strict authorization — JWT + session middleware + permission checks on every route

Multi-tenant by design — AccountID enforced at query, service, and trigger level

Replace-all transactional APIs — deterministic writes with rollback guarantees

Canonical data rules — enforced via schema validation + DB triggers

## 🔐 Authentication, Security & Multi-Tenancy

JWT-based authentication

Active account sessions (multi-account switching)

Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions

Backend-enforced authorization (verifyToken, requirePermission)

Frontend enforcement (route gating + UI affordances)

Cross-tenant isolation verified by tests

## 🌐 Frontend

Next.js (App Router) — server-first rendering with client interactivity where required

TypeScript (strict) — end-to-end type safety

React + Tailwind CSS — componentized UI with utility-first styling

react-i18next — runtime multilingual support (DB-driven translations)

Recharts — dashboards, analytics, and reports

Role-aware routing — SecurePage, permission gating, 403 handling

Tested UI flows — datasheets, estimations, schedules, inventory, accounts

## 📄 PDF & Excel Exports

Puppeteer — pixel-accurate PDF exports (datasheets, estimations, schedules)

ExcelJS — structured, multi-sheet Excel exports with audit sections

Async export jobs — background processing with status, retry, expiry

Embedded audit trails — exports include change logs, approvals, and metadata

## 🗄️ Storage

Database-backed metadata for all core entities

File attachments with canonical reference model (deduplication-safe)

Local public storage for dev/demo

Cloud-ready design (S3/Azure Blob compatible)

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

Extensive automated test suite (API, service, domain, middleware, UI)

Authorization & account-scope tests for every major module

Replace-all and transactional behavior verified

Audit and export correctness tested

Type-check + lint enforced

SpecVerse favors provable correctness over optimistic assumptions.

## 🚀 Deployment & Environments (VPS + Auto-Deploy)

SpecVerse is deployed on a VPS with **separate staging and production environments**:

- **Staging:** `https://stage-specverse.jeffabayon.com`
- **Production:** `https://specverse.jeffabayon.com`

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions → VPS)
On every push:

- `staging` branch → runs CI (lint/type-check/tests/build) → **auto-deploys to staging**
- `main` branch → runs CI → **auto-deploys to production** (gated by repo variable `ENABLE_PROD_DEPLOY=true`)

Deploy behavior on the VPS:
- Creates a new timestamped release folder
- `npm ci` + `npm run build`
- Runs **Flyway migrations** (`db/migrations/sqlserver`)
- Switches the `/current` symlink to the new release
- Restarts PM2 processes for backend + Next.js

### VPS Environment Requirements

⚠ IMPORTANT:
Do not rely on BACKEND_ORIGIN in VPS production.
VPS must use USE_NGINX_PROXY=true and nginx routing.
Next.js rewrites must remain disabled in VPS.

**Required environment variable:**
- `USE_NGINX_PROXY=true` — Disables Next.js rewrites, nginx handles routing

**Nginx configuration:**
- `/api/backend/*` → proxies to backend server (typically `http://localhost:4000`)
- `/` → proxies to Next.js server (typically `http://localhost:3000`)

### Data & migrations
- Schema is managed via Flyway.
- `V0001__initial_schema.sql` is treated as **immutable** (CI enforces this).
- All changes must be introduced via `V0002+` migrations.

## 🖨️ PDF Export (Puppeteer) — Local Dev & CI Notes

SpecVerse uses Puppeteer for PDF generation.

For local development or CI runners:

A Chromium / Chrome binary must be available

Environment variables can be configured to point to the executable

Works in local dev, Render, and Azure environments

This setup ensures consistent, production-quality PDF output across environments.

#### 📄 Local Setup & Development

#### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jmjabayon928/specverse.git
cd specverse

#### Install dependencies
npm install

#### Start development servers
npm run dev-backend
npm run dev

#### Local Production Parity

To run Next.js in production mode locally (matching VPS behavior with `next build` + `next start`):

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```powershell
cd c:\projects\specverse
$env:BACKEND_ORIGIN="http://127.0.0.1:4000"
npm run backend
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend - Production Mode):**
```powershell
cd c:\projects\specverse
$env:NODE_ENV="production"
$env:BACKEND_ORIGIN="http://127.0.0.1:4000"
npm run prod:local:fe
```

**Environment variables:**
- `BACKEND_ORIGIN` — Backend server URL (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`)
- `NODE_ENV=production` — Enables production mode

**Environment configuration**

SpecVerse uses separate environment files for clarity and safety:

**Frontend**
- **.env.local — Next.js frontend configuration**

**Backend**
- **.env — local development**

### .env.production — deployment/runtime configuration

Environment variables cover:

Database connections

Authentication & session settings

Export jobs (PDF / Excel)

Dev-only utilities (disabled in production)

⚠️ Dev-only utilities are explicitly guarded and cannot run in production.

### 🧪 Demo & Recruiter Reset (Local / Dev Only)

For local demos or recruiter walkthroughs, SpecVerse provides dev-only utilities to:

Seed an admin account

Reset the admin password safely

Start from a known clean state

These endpoints are hard-disabled in production builds.

See docs/demo-reset.md
 for:

Required environment flags (DEV_ADMIN_UTILS=1, NODE_ENV !== production)

cURL and PowerShell examples

Recommended demo workflow

### 🧪 Testing & Quality Gates

SpecVerse uses a layered testing strategy covering backend, domain logic, and UI.

**Before opening a PR, run locally:**
- npm ci
- npm run lint
- npm run type-check
- npm test -- --runInBand --no-cache


**The test suite includes:**
- API tests (auth, datasheets, schedules, inventory, estimations, audits)
- Service and domain logic tests
- Schema validation tests
- Permission and authorization guards
- UI tests for critical workflows
- CI
- CI runs on pushes to main, staging, and release/**
- All linting, type-checking, and tests must pass before merge
