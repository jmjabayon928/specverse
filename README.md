## SpecVerse

SpecVerse is a production-grade engineering system of record for EPC, industrial, and facilities projects. It is designed for engineering teams, EPC firms, and asset-heavy organizations that need structured, auditable, and scalable control over engineering data across projects and disciplines.

It unifies datasheets, equipment specifications, schedules, estimations, inventory, verification records, and exports into a single, auditable, multi-tenant platform—designed to scale across disciplines, projects, and organizations.

Unlike traditional tools that treat datasheets as static documents, SpecVerse models engineering data as structured, lifecycle-aware entities with approvals, revisions, traceability, and downstream impact on cost, procurement, and operations.

## 🌟 Key Innovation — Dynamic Engineering Data, Not Static Forms

SpecVerse solves a long-standing engineering bottleneck:
- Every time a new datasheet or schedule format was needed, teams had to build a new app, spreadsheet, or database schema.
- SpecVerse eliminates this entirely.

At its core is a dynamic, no-code template engine:
- Datasheet and schedule structures are configurable at runtime
- Subsections, fields, units, rules, and workflows are defined without code
- No schema or application changes are required for new formats
- Engineers and admins—not developers—own and evolve templates

This enables true no-code engineering configuration, dramatically reducing custom development cost and tool sprawl while improving consistency, auditability, and reuse across projects.

## 🧭 Architectural Positioning

SpecVerse is intentionally designed as:
- A system of record — not a document repository or file manager
- A multi-tenant engineering platform with strict account isolation, roles, and permissions
- A QA/QC and compliance-ready foundation with approvals, verification records, audit trails, and exportable evidence
- An AI-ready platform that can evolve toward assistive intelligence without compromising engineering judgment or accountability

Every architectural decision — schema design, replace-all transactions, audit logging, permission enforcement, and comprehensive testing — reinforces these principles.

- Predictable under change
- Extensible across new phases and modules

---

### 🔐 Access Control, Roles & Permissions

SpecVerse implements a fine-grained, permission-driven RBAC system designed for real engineering, QA/QC, and operations workflows.

Access control is not hard-coded by role.
Instead, roles are collections of explicit permissions, enforced consistently across backend APIs and frontend UI.

#### **Roles (Current)**

SpecVerse supports multiple operational roles aligned with real-world engineering organizations:

**Admin**
- Full system access within an account
- Manages users, roles, permissions, and account settings
- Can override approvals when explicitly permitted

**Manager**
- Oversight role across datasheets, estimations, schedules, and reports
- Typically holds approval, verification, and reporting permissions

**Engineer**
- Creates and edits datasheets, templates, instrumentation, ratings, and schedules
- Cannot approve or override without explicit permissions

**Estimator**
- Focused on estimation creation, editing, verification, and export
- No implicit access to datasheet approval or account management

**QA**
- Verification and inspection-oriented role
- Manages verification records, reviews compliance evidence, and audits changes

**Reviewer**
- Read-heavy role for structured review workflows
- May verify or comment without authoring privileges

**Maintenance**
- Inventory maintenance and operational updates
- Handles maintenance logs, asset condition updates, and related records

**Warehouse**
- Inventory-focused role
- Manages stock levels, transactions, and exports without access to engineering edits

**Viewer**
- Read-only access
- Can view and export permitted records but cannot modify data

Note:
The legacy Supervisor role is deprecated. Its responsibilities are now modeled explicitly through permissions and newer roles (Manager, QA, Reviewer).

### Platform Superadmin (Support / Ops)

SpecVerse includes a dedicated **Platform Superadmin** capability for operational support and system-level maintenance.

Platform Superadmins:

- Are **not tied to any account**
- Do **not inherit account roles or permissions**
- Cannot perform account-scoped actions (engineering, estimation, inventory, etc.)
- Operate only through platform-specific endpoints

Supported actions include:

- Listing active platform administrators
- Granting or revoking platform admin access
- Platform-level audit visibility for support and compliance
- System maintenance and recovery workflows (account reactivation, admin recovery)

Platform Superadmin access is enforced via:

- Dedicated middleware (`verifyTokenOnly` + `requirePlatformAdmin`)
- Database-backed authorization (`PlatformAdmins` table)
- Full audit logging for all grant/revoke actions

This separation ensures:
- Zero cross-tenant privilege leakage
- No accidental escalation into account-level authority
- Clear operational boundaries between support and engineering teams

### Permission Model

Permissions are explicit, composable, and enforceable, covering all major system actions.

Examples include:

**Datasheets**
- DATASHEET_CREATE, DATASHEET_EDIT, DATASHEET_VERIFY, DATASHEET_APPROVE
- DATASHEET_REVISE, DATASHEET_EXPORT, DATASHEET_DELETE

Notes and attachments handled via dedicated permissions

**Templates**
- TEMPLATE_CREATE, TEMPLATE_EDIT, TEMPLATE_VERIFY, TEMPLATE_APPROVE
- TEMPLATE_REVISE, TEMPLATE_EXPORT

**Estimations**
- ESTIMATION_CREATE, ESTIMATION_EDIT, ESTIMATION_VERIFY, ESTIMATION_APPROVE
- ESTIMATION_EXPORT

**Inventory**
- INVENTORY_CREATE, INVENTORY_EDIT, INVENTORY_VIEW

Transactions, maintenance, and exports handled separately

**Facilities & Schedules**
- SCHEDULES_CREATE, SCHEDULES_EDIT, SCHEDULES_VIEW

**Instrumentation & Ratings**

Instrumentation and loop permissions

Ratings and nameplate permissions (create/edit/view)

Verification

VERIFICATION_CREATE, VERIFICATION_EDIT, VERIFICATION_VIEW

Platform & Governance

Role and permission management

Account settings

Audit log access

Export job visibility and cleanup

Explicit system override permissions

Enforcement

Permissions are enforced end-to-end:

Backend

Token verification + permission guards on every protected route

Account-scoped data isolation

No implicit privilege escalation

Frontend

Route-level gating

Conditional UI rendering

Graceful 403 handling

This architecture allows:

Safe delegation of responsibilities

Clear separation of engineering, QA, estimation, and operations
